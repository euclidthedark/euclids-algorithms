# Euclids Algorithms

This library containes multiple data structures and algorithms that be consumed by node application services. Each data structure and algorithm should have both a functional and iterative solution, so the code that is consumed can match both a functional or OOP like style.

## Data Structures

### BST

The BST (Binary Search Tree) data structure is used for opimally storing data that will be searched at a later time.
